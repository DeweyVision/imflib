# How are IMF Compositions delivered or stored?
For delivery or storage, one or more IMF Compositions are combined into a **Delivery**. As illustrated below, a Delivery consists of multiple files, which can be stored on the network or on physical media.

The Asset Map provides a location of all the files included in the Delivery. These files are grouped into one or more logical packages (IMP). Each IMP can, for instance, correspond to a particular purchase order. The list of files that belong to an IMP are listed in a **Packing List** (PKL).
