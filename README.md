# imflib

`imflib` is a library for parsing and manipulating [SMPTE Interoperable Media Format (IMF)](https://www.smpte.org/standards/st2067) packages.  Currently, it is *very* under development, but may be of some use if you'd like to try it out.

Where it stands currently, initial read support is there for:

- ASSETMAP
- PKL (Packing List)
- CPL (Composition Play List)
- OPL (Output Profile List)
- SCM (Sidecar Composition Map)

But there is still more to do.

## Dependencies
