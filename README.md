# imflib

`imflib` is a library for parsing and manipulating [SMPTE Interoperable Media Format (IMF)](https://www.smpte.org/section-events/all-about-imf-interoperable-master-format) packages.  It is currently under development, but may be of some use if you'd like to try it out.

Where it stands currently, initial read support is there for:

- ASSETMAP
- PKL
- CPL
- OPL

But there is still more to do.

## Dependencies
Utilizes [posttools](https://github.com/mjiggidy/posttools) -- also by little ol me.
